 \section{CAVEATS}
 One of main problems with SOM is that this method completely ignores the uncertainties in input data.
 Ignoring the uncertainties is specially problematic in cases with high uncertainties such as: Dust luminosity and mass.
 Unfortunately, with the current SOM packages there is not too many choices, and we could only mention that this result could be highly uncertain.
